# Proportio
*__Tool for creating proportional scales for typography, iconography, spacing, and components in design systems.__*

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/NateBaldwinDesign/Proportio)

## Purpose
Making systematic design faster and easier by use of generative, parametric design. Midas enables designers to use proportional scales to create:
- Type scales
- Icon scales
- Spacing scales
- Component sizes
- Component padding
and more.

## MLP todo list
(Minimum loveable product)
- [ ] Add “round to even numbers” option
- [ ] Add hint text with recommendations like keeping icon scale close to type scale
- [x] Modularize states & clean up props
- [x] Add Feather icons for choosing sample icon: https://github.com/feathericons/feather
- [x] Add variable stroke scale input
- [x] Add google fonts picker for text
- [x] If variable, add variable weight scale
- [x] Add density columns
- [ ] Add mobile scale factor
- [ ] Add mobile or responsive type & icon scales
- [ ] Add export/ save data or CSS, which compiles options into organized code styles
- [ ] Add example UI? Cards, tables, controls, long form typography…
- [ ] Figure out url issues 
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines 
- [ ] Clean up code
- [ ] Typescript?
- [ ] Documentation 
- [ ] iconography for menus and mobile friendly design (maybe use these: https://css.gg/)


## Development
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
